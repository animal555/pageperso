<h1 id="projects">Projects</h1>
<p>This page is written at the destination of my project students, be
they 3rd year or master, whatever curiculum you are currently enrolled
in (so the content is rather generic).</p>
<p>This is being written in early 2024, is not authoritative at all and
possibly outdated - you should probably be checking the <a
href="https://canvas.swansea.ac.uk">canvas</a> webpage for the relevant
modules for general information (CSCM10 and CSP354 iirc) as well as the
<a href="https://csprojectmanager.swansea.ac.uk">CS project
manager</a>.</p>
<h1 id="expectations">Expectations</h1>
<p>Hopefully, you already have a broad ideas of the expectations from
the project module: you should do something that showcases what you have
learned about computer science, write documents/give presentations that
explain what you are planning on doing and how based on background
research you have conducted, carry out the project and then at the end
write a dissertation about your results.</p>
<h1 id="i-was-not-allocated-a-project-what-is-going-on">“I was not
allocated a project, what is going on?”</h1>
<p>No need to panic! Your priority should be to meet with your
supervisor (that should be allocated, if not you should be concerned)
and discuss what to do, which is going to be about picking a project
topic most probably!</p>
<p>Every year some students are in this situation, even when they filled
pre-allocation requests. This simply means they could not be allocated
to their desired preferred supervisor to balance our supervision
workload.</p>
<h1 id="choosing-a-project-topic">Choosing a project topic</h1>
<p>As long as you fit the basic criteria of “related to computer
science”, that you are not planning to engage in some unethical
activites and that your work contains some implementation aspect<a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, you are free to pick whatever
project you like. It can be an idea you come up with or something
inspired from the projects you see on the list on csprojectmanager
(whoever the author of that particular project might be).</p>
<p>On that note, you do not necessarily need to pick a project idea that
I have written up! These projects come from ideas related to my research
interests for a large part, which I know are not to everyone’s taste or
require a specific background for some of them.</p>
<p>I think some advice to bear in mind would be the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>your priority should be to pick a topic you would are invested in
and ready to work on over the course of a few months.</li>
<li>you should have some ideas about the deliverables your project will
have and make sure that this is achievable over the course of the few
months you will be working on it. My assumption is that it is better to
pick something where having something minimalistic to show off is going
to be reasonably easy, but where there is going to be room for
improvement</li>
<li>you can absolutely pick a topic that you do not know all that well,
but do not underestimate the amount of learning you might have to
do.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is fine to pick a project that is completely outside of my area of
expertise, but it means the supervision/feedback I might be able to give
you will not be expert feedback, especially when it comes to technical
matters. I would also be even more challenged when it comes to knowing
what learning resources related to your project or what related work
exist. On the other hand, I will still be able to help you when it comes
to things like academic writing, presenting, using LaTeX, as well as
discuss high-level ideas to sanity check them.</p>
<h1 id="my-research-interests">My research interests</h1>
<p>Something worth bearing in mind: computer science (much like all
academic disciplines) contain a lot of areas, a lot of those I know very
little about.</p>
<p>I work in theoretical science and logic - as such, I spend most of my
research time thinking about theorems rather than programming, although
the mathematical questions I am looking at are very much related to
programming at times!</p>
<p>I think you have been somewhat exposed to related topics during your
lectures. For Swansea modules, think of CS-205, CS-275 and CSC385. I am
also somewhat familiar with formal verification topics like the one
you’d explore in CSCM13.</p>
<p>If you want the more technical overview, you can look at the things I
am working on on my <a
href="https://cs-web.swan.ac.uk/~cpradic">website</a>, but maybe it is
more helpful to say I would be more qualified to help in areas related
to:</p>
<ul>
<li>formal verification</li>
<li>logic</li>
<li>linear logic</li>
<li>interactive theorem proving</li>
<li>functional programming</li>
<li>compilers and semantics of programming languages</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, I know next to nothing about web development (the
sort of web development skills which I find serviceable and I use
day-to-day are on full display here), machine learning, smartphones (I
do not even own one) or HCI.</p>
<h1 id="my-2024-project-list">My 2024 project list</h1>
<p>This year, I was on leave so, if I understand correctly, the projects
I had posted were not published for this round of allocation. I was
asked to relay them, so I am putting them here just in case. This is
copied and pasted (sorry for any formatting issues) and is missing
metadata, you should rather look this up on csprojectmanager if it is
available there! (also do not take the referencing style there as a
reference for your own referencing in your documents you will submit for
assessment!! :))</p>
<p>Another advice, which is specific to the projects I have written: it
is fine to take some inspiration from the prompt but scale down/modify
the objectives/tools being used! I know that some of those might too
ambitious for a lot of students as stated here.</p>
<h2 id="a-computer-aided-gameactivity-for-the-student-conference">A
computer-aided game/activity for the student conference</h2>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>Each year, we bring all of the third year student to a residential
event outside of the university so that they may hone their presentation
skills, tell the department about their exciting projects, but so to
have fun and socialize. Typically, the event welcomes a hundred student
and a dozen staff at a time, three times in a single week.</p>
<p>One of the challenge in organizing the event is setting up compelling
activities that could bring the whole cohort together while not being
too daunting/distracting (committing more than a couple of hours to the
activity would probably be impossible for any of the participants). The
goal of this project would be to design such an activity. For instance,
if you designed a programming competition, you would need to write the
submission interface, some problems, some plan/interface to display
results and documentation to set up the server. The activity itself is
up to you, but you should set up your project such that there is some
programming/CS problems for you to consider to fulfill the
requirements.</p>
<p>You should try to design around the constraint of the event, so I
would recommend talking to me or another organizer to have a bit of an
idea of what would sound reasonable or not :) But besides the
aforementioned constraints, I would stress that documentation and ease
of deployment by others would be a key factor.</p>
<p>Some inspiration for that kind of activities besides past activities
in the department: https://play.battlesnake.com/
https://prologin.org/</p>
<h3 id="preparation">Preparation</h3>
<p>I suspect knowing a bit about web dev would be necessary (unless you
figure something else that would allow for interaction) Otherwise I
would recommend having a discussion with me so that a more concrete idea
that sounds achievable would be.</p>
<h2 id="can-autograder-be-cheated">Can autograder be cheated?</h2>
<h3 id="description-1">Description</h3>
<p>A number of modules in the CS department use
csautograder.swansea.ac.uk that allows to automate part of the grading
of programming homework. This system is a deployment of Autograder.io
(https://eecs-autograder.github.io/autograder.io/) which allows
lecturers to set up homework in a bespoke way. The lecturers typically
write the homework and some code for testing the coursework submission
themselves, and then the system run the code provided by the lecturer
with an access to an individual student submission in a sandboxed
environment (also provided by the lecturer, although those can be
relatively standard).</p>
<p>While the sandboxing and the framework make it safe to assume that
malicious submissions would be unlikely to harm the overall system,
whether the tests and the sandbox environment are 1) correct and 2)
secure from being manipulated is left to the lecturers. Having 1) and 2)
compromised could mean that the automated grading does not award correct
marks. The goal of this project would be to investigate what
vulnerabilities could exist in those individual setups that would allow
to engineer submissions that get full automated marks without actually
solving the coursework questions, and propose some countermeasures less
time-consuming than investigating the submission history of a particular
user. I would be happy to provide some sample grading setups that I
wrote in the past to be put to test, and for an attack on those be
documented.</p>
<h3 id="preparation-1">Preparation</h3>
<p>Probably things related to cybersecurity would be helpful - knowing
that injection attacks exist sure is helpful since you would be
designing some attacks. I do not have experience personally, but am
familiar enough with the tests to help point out some things to try. It
is possible you might need/want to deploy a local instance of autograder
on your computer, so doing that in advance might be nice.</p>
<h2 id="certified-compilation-of-synchronous-languages">Certified
compilation of synchronous languages</h2>
<h3 id="description-2">Description</h3>
<p>Synchronous languages (such as Lustre or Esterel) are specialized
dataflow languages that are meant to process efficiently discrete signal
in real-time. They are typically used in critical systems such as
avionics and compiled to C, but can also be compiled to hardware
description languages such as Verilog.</p>
<p>Rather recently, some effort has been made to develop formally proven
compilers for Lustre into C<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. By formally proven, it
is meant that the compiler is coded in a proof assistant and that, if
the compilation succeeds, the compiled code is trusted to be equivalent
to the source code (to make that assertion precise, one needs to model
mathematically the meaning of a program in both the source and the
target and relate the two).</p>
<p>The goal of this project would be to write other compilers for
(fragments of) Lustre or Esterel that are formally verified (and also
define the relevant semantics when needed). One interesting compilation
target that has not been investigated thus far to the best of my
knowledge would be a fragment of Verilog or something close enough<a
href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> (or any other hardware description
languages). Although less practical, another fun target to look at wold
be finite-state transducers as they would be introduced in an
introduction to computability module.</p>
<h3 id="preparation-2">Preparation</h3>
<p>Getting familiar with a synchronous programming language would be
necessary at some point for the project, but probably the most
challenging aspect would be the getting familiar with interactive
theorem proving on a computer and the field of programming language
semantics. “Software foundations” by Benjamin Pierce and “Certified
Programming with Dependent Types” by Adam Chlipala are two solid
introduction to using the Coq proof assistant with a strong focus on
topics related to the semantics of programming languages, so starting
there might be a good idea.</p>
<h2
id="computing-shortest-paths-efficiently-in-practice-in-sparse-graphs">Computing
shortest paths efficiently in practice in sparse graphs</h2>
<h3 id="description-3">Description</h3>
<p>You probably have learned of some algorithms to compute shortest
distances in directed graphs such as Floyd-Warshall’s algorithm that
works recursively/iteratively.</p>
<p>The goal of this project would be to implement an algorithm recently
introduced by Master<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> that instead adopts a
divide-and-conquer approach that works better on some sparse classes of
graphs. Some implementation in Python already exists, and the goal here
would ideally to provide another implementation that might attempt to
deliver some improvements (only one would be nice already!):</p>
<ul>
<li>the algorithm is interesting in part because it relies on
precomputing some “composition symbols” that depend only on the boundary
size of graphs involved in the divide-and-conquer algorithm. Determining
if some meta-programming might help would be good.</li>
<li>divide-and-conquer approaches often work well with parallelization;
so trying to come up with a (possibly massively) parallel implementation
and benchmark it would be nice; one could think of using MPI for
massively parallel computations</li>
<li>one could try to find especially nice benchmarks/or particularly
nice classes of graphs on which the algorithm behaves well</li>
<li>one could try to explore some similar instances of the algebraic
path problem, like for instance, to algorithm that computes regexp for
large automata</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="preparation-3">Preparation</h3>
<p>I would advise you get familiar with the language/tools needed to
implement, as well as the paper I cite above.</p>
<p>I could help troubleshoot some things with the following: C/C++/OCaml
(OCaml is a functional programming language that also supports
imperative programming and has nice facilities for parallelization and
metaprogramming (BER)).</p>
<h2 id="proving-circuit-designs-correct">Proving circuit designs
correct</h2>
<h3 id="description-4">Description</h3>
<p>The soundness of hardware design is of paramount importance as all
computations ultimately run there. So naturally, hardware verification
has been a huge topic for a long time. But “verification” may mean many
things in the world of hardware, both in terms of techniques and of
properties being guaranteed.</p>
<p>In the world of software verification, interactive theorem provers
(ITPs) have been used to mathematically prove the correctness of
programs with an extreme degree of certainty; this is even arguably easy
for functional programs (correctness of simple functional programs such
as merge sort are often used as tutorials for learning to use ITPs).</p>
<p>In contrast, hardware is not often checked with ITPs. So a worthwhile
project would be to carry out such a verification task for a small
circuit inside a proof assistant. Before starting the task proper, we
would need 1) a hardware description language 2) a semantics for this
language formalized in the ITP 3) a (small) circuit described in that
language and 4) a non-trivial formal specification to prove. For 1) and
2) one could try to re-use code from pre-existing work such as the
artifacts developed for https://people.csail.mit.edu/bthom/pldi20.pdf
For 3) there is a lot of flexibility, but I would recommend starting
small (e.g., an adder) and working up from there.</p>
<p>A sort of expected outcome is the task is much harder than it might
seem at first, due to both “proof-engineering” and “formalization”
reasons. One could hope that this project could serve as an inspiration
to develop a modular way of describing circuits and reasoning about them
(I have been told that one big defect of existing semantics for Verilog
formalized in proof assistants is that they tend to be non-modular and
essentially redefined for each formalization project; another worthwhile
but potentially much more challenging goal would be to try to address
this state of affair).</p>
<h3 id="preparation-4">Preparation</h3>
<p>Getting familiar with a proof assistant such as Coq would be a must;
for this project I would recommend “Software Foundations” by Benjamin
Pierce or “Certified Programming with Dependent Types” by Adam Chlipala
as good resources, as they would also introduce relevant material from
the POV of formalization. Some familiarity with hardware description
languages and basic circuits would also be necessary.</p>
<h2
id="constructing-algebraic-numbers-via-ruler-and-compass-or-origami">Constructing
algebraic numbers via ruler and compass or origami</h2>
<h3 id="description-5">Description</h3>
<p>The algebraic numbers consist of a subset of the real numbers that
are roots of of polynomials with rational coefficient. For instance, 5,
0.5, √10 and √√2 are algebraic, while π and e aren’t. This is a rather
natural extension of the rationals which enjoy a number of nice
properties, the following being the starting point for this project
prompt:</p>
<ul>
<li>one can do exact computations over algebraic numbers, while we can’t
do that with real numbers</li>
<li>every set of numbers in ℝ² that one can build (starting from the set
{(0,0),(0,1)}) as intersections of lines/circles drawn using a ruler and
a compass is algebraic</li>
<li>similarly if we look at points created using origami folds (while it
might seem daunting, this class of numbers was axiomatized, see
e.g. https://www.langorigami.com/article/huzita-justin-axioms/)
http://mars.wne.edu/~thull/origamimath.html</li>
</ul>
<p>One goal of a project along these lines would be to build a tool
that, given an algebraic number, answer whether or not it is
constructible using either a sequence of ruler and compass moves or
origami, and if yes, produce a sequence of steps to do so. The intent is
that it would be a used as an educational resource, so you have quite a
bit of freedom on what the final product would look like. For instance
we might want to have an interactive visualization of the constructions.
One can also think of straightforward extensions, like allowing to set
goals which are not algebraic and looking to produce approximation
within a certain error bound or trying to optimise/compare the number of
required steps.</p>
<p>I am also open to discuss options on those themes which are slightly
different in scope; for instance, developing a suitable library for
field extensions (over generic computable fields) in the language of
your choice.</p>
<h3 id="preparation-5">Preparation</h3>
<p>One should be prepared to know the basics regarding the theory of
field extensions, but only the basics should be really necessary;
knowing enough to realize that ruler and compass numbers lie in fields
whose dimension is a power of 2 and origami in fields of dimension <span
class="math inline">2<sup><em>n</em></sup>3<sup><em>m</em></sup></span>
+ some basics on how to compute with exact representations of algebraic
numbers should be enough for this project.</p>
<p>The second task would be to narrow down the technologies used an the
goals you want to focus on.</p>
<h2 id="visualization-of-algebraic-datatypes">Visualization of algebraic
datatypes</h2>
<h3 id="description-6">Description</h3>
<p>Algebraic datatypes (ADTs) are one of the “killer feature” of a wide
variety of functional programming languages like Haskell and OCaml. They
are typically useful to encode enumeration and intricate tree-like
datatypes, which are pervasives in a wide range of application (for
instance, manipulating ASTs in compilers). For instance, a Haskell ADT
definition for binary trees is</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre
class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">data</span> <span class="dt">BTree</span> a <span class="ot">=</span> <span class="dt">Leaf</span> a <span class="op">|</span> <span class="dt">Node</span> <span class="dt">BTree</span> <span class="dt">BTree</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>For beginners, linking formal definitions like these with graphical
representation of trees can be challenging, especially since the formal
definitions of values can become unwieldly pretty fast. Having a handy
way to convert values of type, say, BTree Int, to a graphical
representation with a simple call of a helper function in ghci would be
massively helpful.</p>
<p>So the goal for this project would be to write a library that allows
to easily display values from a large array of user-defined datatypes in
Haskell. This should be done using typeclasses and generics, so that
this would work with custom datatypes typically used for tree-like
structure. Concretely, this would mean providing a typeclass GShow with
a method</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre
class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ot">gshow ::</span> <span class="dt">GShow</span> a <span class="ot">=&gt;</span> a <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">IO</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<p>and enough boilerplate so that compiling a file containing the three
lines</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre
class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">import</span> <span class="dt">NameOfLibrary</span></span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">data</span> <span class="dt">BTree</span> a <span class="ot">=</span> <span class="dt">Leaf</span> a <span class="op">|</span> <span class="dt">Node</span> <span class="dt">BTree</span> <span class="dt">BTree</span> <span class="kw">deriving</span> <span class="dt">GShow</span></span>
<span id="cb3-3"><a href="#cb3-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>main <span class="ot">=</span> gshow (<span class="dt">Node</span> (<span class="dt">Leaf</span> <span class="dv">2</span>) (<span class="dt">Leaf</span> <span class="dv">3</span>))</span></code></pre></div>
<p>would produce an executable that open a graphical window with the
corresponding tree with three nodes displayed.</p>
<p>There are many challenges and extensions related both to the more
vizualization and programming language-related aspects, as well as some
room for non-trivial design decisions.</p>
<h3 id="preparation-6">Preparation</h3>
<p>Having a good understanding of the Haskell part of the declarative
programming module would be ideal. To have general framework that is
convenient for the user, the project would ideally require to go beyond
this material and get to grips with implementing typeclasses and using
generics, so reading up on them beforehand would be helpful.</p>
<p>On the rendering side of things, you are free to use whatever
third-party library to help display the tree-like structure at first or
you might like to deploy your own solutions. My reflex would be to use
graphviz for a first prototype and maybe look into popular Haskell
packages for displays such as e.g. Diagrams.</p>
<p>Some related works exist that you should investigate, in particular
the following, which are about visualizing the precise structure of
these things in memory: https://dennis.felsing.org/ghc-vis,

rather than Haskell, but the idea is the same).</p>

with other languages/tools in mind!</p>
<h2 id="mechanized-theorem-proving">Mechanized theorem proving</h2>
<h3 id="description-7">Description</h3>
<p>Interactive theorem provers (sometimes called proof assistants) are
software that allow to write general-purpose mathematical proofs and
have them checked by a computer. They usually come with their own
language to write down proofs and with a variety of foundations. Among
the most notorious are Coq (https://coq.inria.fr/), agda
(https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/v2.6.2.1/index.html) and lean
(https://leanprover-community.github.io/), and they also have in common
the fact that they are based on dependent type theories, systems that
can be seen as both as foundational mathematical theories and functional
programming languages equipped with a very rich typed system.</p>
<p>Writing proofs or programs in these systems does take some effort
(both learning to use the systems and use them). I can supervise a
project that aims to formalize a piece of mathematics or the correctness
of some algorithm in it and am very happy to discuss options (please see
also my other projects prompts if interested; a lot of them can involve
proof assistant as a way of verifying things).</p>
<h3 id="preparation-7">Preparation</h3>
<p>Get familiar with the proof assistant that’d you’d want to use and
the mathematics/algorithmics related to what you’d like to
formalize.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>I <em>believe</em> sometimes it is possible to do a
project without an implementation aspect, but this might affect the
classification of your degree if you are in year 3 and do this. I am not
sure of what is the status of this, so you should clarify that with
someone who knows (e.g., the lecturer delivering your module about
projects).<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"

category theory, but nothing extremely advanced and I am happy to spend
some time explaining it to you with less categorical language - but you
would need to engage with a bit of maths. If that project would interest
you, feel free to come to me to talk about it/what I can support.<a
