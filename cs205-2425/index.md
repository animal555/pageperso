Some of the files used alongside the lectures in the 2024 edition of the
declarative programming module in Swansea. They mostly attempt to explain
Haskell notions seen in the module as well as give examples, translated to html.
While this is meant to cover most of the notions seen in the module (and more),
those files are not quite exhaustive and probably should have been proofread a
bit better :)


* [a first taste of Haskell](taster.html) ([the relevant slides](../cs205-2425-files/introduction.pdf))

* [the type system](types.html)

* [ifthenelse, pattern-matching and guarded equations](conditionals.html)

* [higher-order functions](higherorder.html)

* [type aliases, algebraic datatypes](adt.html)

* [interactive programs and side-effects](ioExamples.html)

* [list comprehension](listComprehension.html)

* [monads and laziness (not needed for the exam)](monadsAndLaziness.html)
           ([slides for monads](../cs205-2425-files/iomonad.pdf),
            [for laziness and to close the FP part of the module](../cs205-2425-files/laziness.pdf))

* [the finite probablity monad (not needed for the exam)](probabilityMonadExample.html)

You may find some of the additional files supporting the module that I can
freely disseminate [here](../cs205-2425-files), as well as the `.hs` files that
generated the webpages above.
